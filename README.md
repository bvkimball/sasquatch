# Sasquatch v0.21
This library contains necessary classes for reading binary sas files. Sasquatch is a AS3 library for reading data sets in the .sas7bdat format, commonly used in the SAS statistical software system.

I have included in the downloads section an installer for a application I built using this library. It is built in Adobe AIR so it should run on all OS that support that.

The majority of the work in this project is derived from Matt Shotwell's sas7bdat project, an R-based SAS reader and the SassyReader? project from eobjects.org
